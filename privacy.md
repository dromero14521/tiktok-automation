# Privacy Policy for Nth Automations

**Last Updated:** May 16, 2024

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the "Nth Automations" tool (the "Service") handles your information. The Service is a personal automation tool designed with privacy as a core principle.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

This is a fundamental principle of our Service:

- **We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.**
- **We do not have a database, server, or any mechanism to retain your information.**
- The Service operates as a client-side automation workflow on the n8n platform.

## 3. Information Processed Temporarily

For the sole purpose of functionality, the Service interacts with third-party APIs. The following data is processed but **is never persisted or stored by us**:

- **TikTok API Data:** Your TikTok access token is used only to authenticate API requests for uploading videos. It is stored securely within your own n8n instance and is never transmitted to our servers.
- **Third-Party Service Data:** The Service sends data (e.g., script text to OpenAI, video clips to Shotstack) to these APIs to perform its function. This data is handled according to the respective privacy policies of OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Pexels, and Shotstack.

## 4. Data Security

Since no data is collected by Nth Automations, the risk of a data breach from our Service is eliminated. You are responsible for securing your own n8n instance and the API keys stored within it.

## 5. Third-Party Services

This Service relies on the following third-party services. We encourage you to review their privacy policies:
- **TikTok:** [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy)
